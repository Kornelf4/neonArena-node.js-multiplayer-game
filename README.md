<h1>NeonArena</h1>

<p>The simple nodejs based multiplayer bullet hell arena, made in a weekend.</p>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
Good question.
It's my first nodejs project, made just for fun.
It's in prototype phase updates soon.

<h2>What it's used for?</h2>
It's designed to play small matches with your friends (or enemies).
Up to 5 players it can be laggy/buggy.

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
Only the host needs to download this.</br>
Steps to host the game:</br>
1. Download or clone this.</br>
2. Download node.js</br>
3. Sorry, you have to edit the app.js file with VS Code or other IDE. So open the forder in it.</br>
4. At the line 348 you will see a veriable named host. You have to change this variable to your v4 IP address.</br>
5. Save the file and close the folder.</br>
6. Open terminal or cmd. Navigate to neonArena folder, and run: </br>
node app.js
7. The code will print an HTTP URL. Your friends can join by this (in the same network). That server runs on port 6567 (Same as mindustry multiplayer!!)</br>

Congratulations! You set up your neonArena local server. </br>
Your friends didn't need to download this or node.js, they can just paste the HTTP URL to the browser. </br>
